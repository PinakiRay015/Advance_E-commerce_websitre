    <h1>Social Media</h1>


    <p>The idea that social media are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too
        broad, as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the telegraph and telephone are also
        social media.[36] The terminology is unclear, with some early researchers referring to social media as social
        networks or social networking services in the mid 2000s.A more recent paper from 2015 reviewed the prominent
        literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current social media services</p>
